# ML - with Toukir

This repository is for tracking my Learning Journey of Machine Learning. I will be pushing all my ML practice code here in different directories.

## Who am I?

I am [Toukir](https://toukirazad.com/), I develop web apps and I am a Master's Degree student at [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en).

I mostly work with [php-laravel](https://laravel.com/), [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [ReactJs](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://react.dev/learn/typescript) with ReactJs and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
. As a Quantum Information Science student I am getting insights in Quantum Technologies, Quantum Compilers, Quantum Algorithms and Machine Learning, Network Security and Quantum Programming Languages such as [IBM-QisKit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides), [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq).

## Why ML?
Machine Learning is an essential knowledge in this era specially who works with technologies. Everyone knows ChatGPT, DeepSeek or Midjourney, these are nothing but an outcome of ML. I always wonder how they work, how people train such amazing models. And for this thirst, I thought why not make a try. So I have started.

I am thankful to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for providing me such a nice and powerful course [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) for free. It helps me to build the foundational understanding of the ML concepts. I am hoping to complete the course soon.

## About this repository
I am practising hands on ML along with diving deep into the concepts. This repository is nothing but a storage to put my practiced exercises and everyone is welcome to have a look and try these exercises by their own.

I am using data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) in most of the exercises and I will try to upload corresponding data file in this repository in every exercise directory.

Every directory represents one individual exercise and directory naming is based on the topic I am practicing. I will definitely try to make sure every exercise contains proper commenting so that anybody can unserstand.

Feel free to clone the repository, and practice by yourself.
